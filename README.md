# Neataptic [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wagenaartje/neataptic.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wagenaartje/neataptic)

Neataptic is th√© Javascript neural network solution. Not only does it allow you to create neural networks on-the-go, it also allows you
to visualise your networks to understand what's really going on. An important aspect that neataptic introduces in comparison with its
competitors is neuro-evolution. You can evolve neural networks through a process described in the 
[NEAT](http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.gecco02_1.pdf) paper. Scroll down for some examples!

## Usage
Head over to the [wiki](https://github.com/wagenaartje/neataptic/wiki) for detailed usage. If you want to visualise your graphs, head
over to the [graph](https://github.com/wagenaartje/neataptic/tree/master/graph) folder. This example shows how to create a basic neural network, and teaching it to perform as an XOR gate:

```javascript
var network = new Architect.Perceptron(2,4,1);
var trainer = new Trainer(network); 

// Train the XOR gate
trainer.train([
  { input: [0,0], output: [0] },
  { input: [0,1], output: [1] },
  { input: [1,0], output: [1] },
  { input: [1,1], output: [0] },
],
{
  iterations: 5000,
}
);
```

## Examples
Neural networks can be used for nearly anything; driving a car, playing a game and even to predict words! At this moment, 
the website only displays a small amount of examples. If you have an interesting project that you want to share with other users
of Neataptic, feel free to create a pull request!
