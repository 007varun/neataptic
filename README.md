Gynaptic
========
Gynaptic is an architecture-free [neural network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network) library with implementations to create [genetic neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroevolution). It gives the user the ability to create train neurol networks with evolutionary algorithms with just a few lines of code. The library is constantly updated with new mutation, crossover and selection methods. Gynaptics' main neural network code comes from the library [Synaptic](https://github.com/cazala/synaptic) by [Juan Cazala](https://github.com/cazala). Gynaptic will stay up to date with Synaptic's improvements as much as possible.

## Usage
Head over to the [wiki](https://github.com/wagenaartje/gynaptic/wiki) for documentation.

## Planned improvements
- Turn connections into objects
- Create the ability to crossover connections
