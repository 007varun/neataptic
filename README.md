# Neataptic [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wagenaartje/neataptic.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wagenaartje/neataptic)

Neataptic is th√© Javascript neural network solution. Not only does it allow you to create neural networks on-the-go, it also allows you
to visualise your networks to understand what's really going on. An important aspect that neataptic introduces in comparison with its
competitors is neuro-evolution. You can evolve neural networks through a process described in the
[NEAT](http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.gecco02_1.pdf) paper. An example of neuro-evolution is [Agar.io AI](https://wagenaartje.github.io/neataptic/articles/agario/), where neural agents learn to play Agar.io by evolving their topology! Appreciate the repo?

## Examples
Neural networks can be used for nearly anything; driving a car, playing a game and even to predict words! At this moment,
the website only displays a small amount of examples. If you have an interesting project that you want to share with other users
of Neataptic, feel free to create a pull request!

Simultaneous evolution:
- [Agar.io](https://wagenaartje.github.io/neataptic/articles/agario/)
- Car steering (coming soon!)


Sequential evolution:
- [Evolve XOR](https://wagenaartje.github.io/neataptic/articles/evolvexor/)
- [Color classification](https://wagenaartje.github.io/neataptic/articles/classifycolors)

Furthermore:
- [Crossover](https://wagenaartje.github.io/neataptic/articles/crossover/)

## Usage
Head over to the [wiki](https://github.com/wagenaartje/neataptic/wiki) for detailed usage. If you want to visualise your graphs, head
over to the [graph](https://github.com/wagenaartje/neataptic/tree/master/graph) folder. This example shows how to create a basic neural network, and teaching it to perform as an XOR gate:

```javascript
var network = new Architect.Perceptron(2,4,1);

// Train the XOR gate
network.train([{ input: [0,0], output: [0] },
               { input: [0,1], output: [1] },
               { input: [1,0], output: [1] },
               { input: [1,1], output: [0] }]);

network.activate([0,1]); // 0.9824...
```

You can also create <b>Long short-term memory</b> networks:

```javascript
var network = new Architect.LSTM(1,1,1);

// Train the XOR gate (in sequence!)
lstm.train([{ input: [0], output: [0]},
            { input: [1], output: [1]},
            { input: [1], output: [0]},
            { input: [0], output: [1]},
            { input: [0], output: [0]}]);

// It now outputs a high value when input is changed :)
lstm.activate([0]); // 0.0004
lstm.activate([1]); // 0.8994
lstm.activate([1]); // 0.0921
lstm.activate([0]); // 0.9493
lstm.activate([0]); // 0.03328
```
