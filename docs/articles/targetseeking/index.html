              In the simulation below, neural networks that have been evolved through roughly
              100 generations try to seek a target. Their goal is to stay as close to the target
              as possible at all times. If you want to see how one of these networks looks like,
              check out the <a href="https://wagenaartje.github.io/target-seeking-ai/">complete simulation</a>.

              The neural agents are actually performing really well. At least one agent will have
              'solved the problem' after roughly 20 generations. That is because the base of the solution
              is quite easy: one of the inputs of the neural networks is the angle to the target, so all it
              has to do is output some value that is similar to this input value. This can easily be done
              through the identity activation function, but surprisingly, most agents in the simulation above
              tend to avoid this function.

              I will focus more on the settings and inputs/outputs of the algorithm itself.

            <h3 class="blocktext">The agents</h3>
            <p class="article-text">
              The agents' task is very simple. They have to get in the vicinity of the target which is set to about
              100 pixels, once they are in that vicinity, each agents' score will be increased proportionally (100 - dist)
              to the distance. There is one extra though: for every node in the agents' network, the score of the agent will
              be decreased. This has two reasons; 1. networks shouldn't overfit the solution and 2. having smaller networks
              reduces computation power.
            </p>
            <p class="article-text">
              Agents have some kind of momentum. They don't have mass, but they do have acceleration, so it takes a small
              amount of time for a agent to reach the top speed in a certain direction.
            </p>
            <p class="article-text">
              <b>Each agent has the following inputs:</b>
              <ul>
                <li>Its own speed in the x-axis</li>
                <li>Its own speed in the y-axis</li>
                <li>The targets' speed in the x-axis</li>
                <li>The targets' speed in the y-axis</li>
                <li>The angle towards the target</li>
                <li>The distance to the target</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="article-text">
              The output of each agent is just the desired movement direction.
            </p>
            <p class="article-text">
              There is no kind of collision, except for the walls of the fields. In the future, it might be interesting to
              add collisions between multiple agents and/or the target to reveal some new tactics. This would require the
              agent to know the location of surrounding agents.
            </p>
            <h3 class="blocktext">The target</h3>
            <p class="article-text">
              The target is fairly easy. It's programmed to switch direction every now and then by a random amount. There
              is one important thing however: <i>the target moves with half the speed of the agents</i>, this makes sure
              that agents always have the ability to catch up with the target. Apart from that, the physics for the target
              are similar to the agents' physics.
            </p>
            <h3 class="blocktext">The genetic algorithm</h3>
            <p class="article-text">
              The genetic algorithm is the core of the AI. In the first frame, a certain
              amount of players are initialized with a neural network as brain. The brains
              represent the population of a generation. These brains are then evolved by
              putting the entire population in Ã³ne playing field and letting them compete
              against each other. The fittest brains are moved on the next generation,
              the less fit brains have a high chance of being removed.
            </p>
            <pre>
// Networks shouldn't get too big
for(var genome in neat.population){
  genome = neat.population[genome];
  genome.score -= genome.nodes.length * SCORE_RADIUS / 10;
}

// Sort the population by score
neat.sort();

// Draw the best genome
drawGraph(neat.population[0].graph($('.best').width(), $('.best').height()), '.best', false);

// Init new pop
var newPopulation = [];

// Elitism
for(var i = 0; i < neat.elitism; i++){
  newPopulation.push(neat.population[i]);
}

// Breed the next individuals
for(var i = 0; i < neat.popsize - neat.elitism; i++){
  newPopulation.push(neat.getOffspring());
}

// Replace the old population with the new population
neat.population = newPopulation;
neat.mutate();

neat.generation++;
startEvaluation();
};</pre>
            <p class="article-text">
              The above code shows the code run when the evaluation is finished. It is very similar
              to the built-in evolve() function of Neataptic, however adapted to avoid a fitness
              function as all genomes must be evaluated at the same time.
            </p>
            <p class="article-text">
              The scoring of the genomes is quite easy: when a certain amount of iterations has been reached,
              each genome is ranked by their final score. Genomes with a higher score have a small amount of nodes
              and have been close to the target throughout the iteration.
